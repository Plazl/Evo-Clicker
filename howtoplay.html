	 <b>Upgrades:</b>
	 <br>Upgrading a mouse can do many useful things for progression. For example, if you were to lower the debounce time to one ms along with maxing the click multiplier, you would get a whopping 69420 clicks per second. But there are other upgrades such as click lifetime, acusation time (the time the click takes to travel from a mouse to a computer), autobuyers, and the max multiplier you can get.

<div style="text-align: left" id="div3" class="hidden">
          <b>Infinity:</b>
          <br>
  	  Infinity is a forced prestige and the first of many layers of prestige. To reach infinity, you must reach 1.79e308 clicks as this is when devices will recognize it as an overflow error. Once you infinity, you gain an infinity click wich can be used for buying infinimice, making even the worst mouse semi-useful.
          Prestiging works by reaching a point where you can't go any further. When you reach this point, you can reset the game for a substantial buff

          <b>Infiniclicks:</b>
          <br>
              When you infinity, you gain an infiniclick. The main purpose of these is to buy infinimice, wich act as a multiplier for all of your pre-infinity upgrades.
